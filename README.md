# Example Proof of Concept
```bash
Save the script: Save the bash script as deploy_website.sh.
Make the script executable: Run chmod +x deploy_website.sh in your terminal.
Run the script: Execute the script with sudo ./deploy_website.sh.
Your website will be deployed at http://localhost, with both pages (index.html and trusted_content.html) available.
```
This bash script deploys two HTML files on a Linux system. The first HTML file, index.html, simulates a malware scenario using an iframe to load content and a button to simulate malicious actions. It mimics Inter-process Communication (IPC) behavior and logs actions to a console. The script also provides an educational demonstration of potential malicious behaviors, like sending simulated IPC messages. The second HTML file, trusted_content.html, contains safe, non-malicious content, displaying a button that triggers a harmless alert. The bash script ensures that these files are created on the system, the necessary web server directory structure is set up, and the files are served by a web server like Apache, making the content accessible through a web browser. This setup provides a clear educational demonstration of the difference between malicious and trusted content.
